Fibonacci FizzBuzz

Writing a Python function that generates the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence, but with a twist:
- For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
- For numbers divisible by 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
- For numbers divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

Requirements:
 - The function should take an integer `n` as input, representing the count of Fibonacci numbers to generate.
 - Display each term according to the rules above
